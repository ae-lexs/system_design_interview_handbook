## 1. The Four Pillars of Distributed Systems

Every distributed system design is fundamentally a negotiation among four core properties. Understanding their interdependencies is essential for articulating trade-offs in interviews.

### The Core Insight

**System Invariant:** You cannot maximize all properties simultaneously. Every design decision trades one property for another.

| If You Optimize For... | You Often Sacrifice... | Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Maximum availability | Consistency (during partitions) | Cassandra accepting writes during partition |
| Strong consistency | Availability and latency | Spanner waiting for global replication |
| Low latency | Durability (sync writes) | Redis with async persistence |
| High throughput | Per-request latency (batching) | Kafka batching messages |

### Mental Model: The System Design Compass

Before diving into any design, orient yourself:

```
                     CONSISTENCY
                          ↑
                          |
     AVAILABILITY ←———————+———————→ EFFICIENCY
                          |
                          ↓
                     SCALABILITY
```

**Interview Pattern:** When asked to design a system, first establish which direction on this compass the requirements pull you.

## 2. Scalability

### Definition

Scalability is the capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources proportionally. A truly scalable system maintains performance characteristics as load increases.

**Key Distinction:**
- **Scalable:** 2x resources → 2x capacity (linear scaling)
- **Not scalable:** 2x resources → 1.5x capacity (diminishing returns)

### Scalability Laws

#### Amdahl's Law — The Parallelization Limit

> **Reference:** Amdahl, G. M. (1967). "Validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities." AFIPS Conference Proceedings.

**Principle:** The maximum speedup from parallelization is limited by the serial (non-parallelizable) portion of the workload.

```
                    1
Speedup(N) = ─────────────────
             S + (1 - S) / N

Where:
  N = Number of processors/nodes
  S = Serial fraction (0 to 1)
  (1-S) = Parallel fraction
```

**Practical Implications:**

| Serial Fraction (S) | Max Speedup (N→∞) | Reality Check |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 5% | 20× | Database locking, coordination |
| 10% | 10× | Distributed transactions |
| 25% | 4× | Heavy synchronization |
| 50% | 2× | Serial algorithms |

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Amdahl's Law Example: 10% Serial"
        A["1 node: 100 units"] --> B["10 nodes: 10.5× speedup"]
        B --> C["100 nodes: 10.9× speedup"]
        C --> D["∞ nodes: 10× max speedup"]
    end
```

**Interview Insight:** "No matter how many servers we add, if 10% of our workload is serial (like acquiring distributed locks), we can never exceed 10× the single-node throughput."

#### Universal Scalability Law (USL) — The Real-World Limit

> **Reference:** Gunther, N. J. (2007). "Guerrilla Capacity Planning." Springer. See also: [http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html)

**Principle:** Extends Amdahl's Law to account for coordination overhead between nodes.

```
                        N
Throughput(N) = ──────────────────────────
                1 + σ(N-1) + κN(N-1)

Where:
  N = Number of nodes
  σ = Contention coefficient (serialization overhead)
  κ = Coherency coefficient (crosstalk/coordination overhead)
```

**Key Insight:** USL explains why throughput can *decrease* after adding too many nodes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "USL: Why More Isn't Always Better"
        N1["1 node: 1,000 TPS"]
        N2["4 nodes: 3,200 TPS"]
        N3["8 nodes: 4,500 TPS"]
        N4["16 nodes: 4,200 TPS ⚠️ Degradation"]
        N5["32 nodes: 3,000 TPS ⚠️ Worse!"]

        N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4 --> N5
    end

    Note["Coherency overhead (cache invalidation,<br/>distributed locks) causes N² overhead"]
```

| Component | Contention Sources (σ) | Coherency Sources (κ) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Database** | Connection pooling, locks | Cache invalidation, replication lag |
| **Cache** | Lock contention | Cache coherence protocols |
| **Services** | Thread pools | Distributed consensus |
| **Messaging** | Partition assignment | Consumer group rebalancing |

**Production Example:**

```
Observed: Adding nodes beyond 12 decreased throughput

Analysis:
- Measured σ = 0.02 (2% contention)
- Measured κ = 0.005 (0.5% coherency)
- Optimal node count = √(1-σ)/κ = √0.98/0.005 ≈ 14 nodes

Action: Cap cluster at 12-14 nodes, shard for further scaling
```

**Interview Phrase:** "Before blindly adding more nodes, I'd measure our contention and coherency coefficients. The Universal Scalability Law tells us there's an optimal cluster size, beyond which coordination overhead causes throughput to decrease."

### The Two Dimensions of Scaling

```mermaid

    subgraph "Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)"
        V1["Small Server<br/>4 CPU, 8GB RAM"] 
        V2["Medium Server<br/>16 CPU, 64GB RAM"]
        V3["Large Server<br/>64 CPU, 256GB RAM"]
        V1 --> V2 --> V3
    end
    
    subgraph "Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)"

        LB --> H3
        LB --> H4
    end
    
    V3 -.->|"Hit ceiling?<br/>Must go horizontal"| LB
```

### Detailed Comparison

| Dimension | Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Add CPU, RAM, storage to existing machine | Add more machines to the pool |
| **Upper Bound** | Hardware ceiling (~256 cores, ~12TB RAM as of 2024) | Theoretically unlimited |
| **Failure Mode** | Single point of failure | Partial degradation |
| **State Management** | Trivial (single machine) | Complex (distributed state) |
| **Cost Curve** | Exponential (premium hardware) | Linear (commodity hardware) |
| **Downtime for Scaling** | Usually required | Zero with proper orchestration |
| **Application Changes** | None | May need redesign (stateless, sharding) |
| **Network Overhead** | None | Significant (serialization, latency) |

### Scalability Patterns by Component

| Component | Vertical Strategy | Horizontal Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Web servers** | Bigger instance | Add servers behind LB |
| **Application servers** | Bigger instance | Add instances (stateless) |
| **Database (reads)** | Better hardware, indexes | Read replicas |
| **Database (writes)** | Better hardware | Sharding/partitioning |
| **Cache** | More RAM | Distributed cache (Redis Cluster) |
| **File storage** | Bigger disk | Distributed storage (S3, HDFS) |

### Interview Prompt & Strong Answer

> **Q: "When would you choose vertical over horizontal scaling?"**

**Framework Answer:**

"I'd choose **vertical scaling** when:
1. **Speed matters** — it's faster to upgrade than redesign
2. **State is complex** — e.g., relational database with many JOINs
3. **Workload is predictable** — we know the ceiling we need
4. **Cost isn't exponential yet** — commodity sizes are sufficient

I'd choose **horizontal scaling** when:
1. **Fault tolerance is required** — no single point of failure
2. **Growth is unbounded** — we can't predict the ceiling
3. **Workload is parallelizable** — stateless, independent requests
4. **Cost efficiency at scale** — commodity hardware is cheaper

**The key insight:** Vertical scaling is simpler but has a ceiling. Most production systems eventually need horizontal scaling, which requires designing for distribution from the start—stateless services, externalized state, and partitioning strategies."

## 3. Availability

### Definition

Availability is the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when needed. It's measured as a percentage of uptime over a given period.

```
                    Uptime
Availability = ─────────────────
               Uptime + Downtime
```

### The Nines of Availability

| Availability | Common Name | Downtime/Year | Downtime/Month | Downtime/Week | Typical Use Case |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| 99% | Two nines | 3.65 days | 7.31 hours | 1.68 hours | Internal tools, batch jobs |
| 99.9% | Three nines | 8.76 hours | 43.8 minutes | 10.1 minutes | Business applications |
| 99.95% | Three and a half | 4.38 hours | 21.9 minutes | 5.04 minutes | E-commerce, SaaS |
| 99.99% | Four nines | 52.6 minutes | 4.38 minutes | 1.01 minutes | Financial systems |
| 99.999% | Five nines | 5.26 minutes | 26.3 seconds | 6.05 seconds | Critical infrastructure |
| 99.9999% | Six nines | 31.5 seconds | 2.63 seconds | 0.6 seconds | Life-critical systems |

### Availability Math for Distributed Systems

**Serial Components (all must work):**
```
A_total = A₁ × A₂ × A₃ × ... × Aₙ

Example: Web → App → DB (each 99.9%)
A = 0.999 × 0.999 × 0.999 = 99.7%
```

**Parallel Components (any one works):**
```
A_total = 1 - (1 - A₁) × (1 - A₂) × ... × (1 - Aₙ)

Example: Two load balancers (each 99.9%)
A = 1 - (0.001 × 0.001) = 99.9999%
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Serial (Weakest Link)"
        S1[Component A<br/>99.9%] --> S2[Component B<br/>99.9%] --> S3[Component C<br/>99.9%]
    end
    
    subgraph "Parallel (Redundancy)"
        P1[Primary<br/>99.9%]
        P2[Backup<br/>99.9%]
    end
    
    S3 -.->|"Total: 99.7%"| NOTE1[Each component<br/>reduces total]
    P2 -.->|"Total: 99.9999%"| NOTE2[Redundancy<br/>multiplies nines]
```

### Single Points of Failure (SPOF)

**System Invariant:** Any component whose failure causes system-wide failure is a SPOF and must be eliminated for high availability.

| Common SPOF | Mitigation Strategy | Trade-off |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Single database | Primary-replica replication | Consistency lag, cost |
| Single load balancer | Active-passive or active-active pair | Complexity, cost |
| Single data center | Multi-region deployment | Latency, complexity |
| Single DNS provider | Multiple DNS providers | Management overhead |
| Single network path | Multiple ISPs/paths | Cost |
| Single deployment | Blue-green or canary deployment | Operational complexity |

        AP_P[Primary<br/>Handles Traffic]

        AA_LB --> AA_2
        AA_1 <-->|"Sync"| AA_2
    end
    
    subgraph "Multi-Region"
        DNS[DNS/Global LB]
        R1[Region 1]
        R2[Region 2]
        DNS --> R1
        DNS --> R2
        R1 <-->|"Cross-region<br/>replication"| R2
    end
```

### Availability vs Reliability: Critical Distinction

| Aspect | Availability | Reliability |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Question** | "Is it responding?" | "Is it correct?" |
| **Measures** | Uptime percentage | Error rate, MTBF |
| **Can have** | High availability + low reliability | High reliability + low availability |
| **Example** | System responds but returns wrong data | System is down for maintenance but never corrupts |

**System Invariant:** A system can be highly available (always responding) but unreliable (sometimes returning wrong data). Reliability implies some level of availability, but availability doesn't guarantee reliability.

---

## 4. Reliability

### Definition

Reliability is the probability that a system will perform its intended function correctly over a specified period under stated conditions.

### Key Reliability Metrics

| Metric | Full Name | Definition | Formula |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **MTBF** | Mean Time Between Failures | Average time between system failures | Total uptime / Number of failures |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time To Recovery | Average time to restore service | Total downtime / Number of failures |
| **MTTF** | Mean Time To Failure | For non-repairable components | Total time / Number of units |
| **MTTD** | Mean Time To Detect | Time to discover a failure occurred | Detection time / Number of failures |
| **MTTI** | Mean Time To Investigate | Time to identify root cause | Investigation time / Number of failures |

#### The Availability Formula

```
                MTBF                 Uptime
Availability = ───────────── = ─────────────────
               MTBF + MTTR     Uptime + Downtime
```

**Practical Calculation Example:**

```
Scenario: Service had 3 outages last year
- Outage 1: 2 hours
- Outage 2: 30 minutes
- Outage 3: 1.5 hours
- Total uptime: 8,760 - 4 = 8,756 hours

MTBF = 8,756 / 3 = 2,919 hours (122 days)
MTTR = 4 / 3 = 1.33 hours (80 minutes)

Availability = 2,919 / (2,919 + 1.33) = 99.954% (3.5 nines)
```

#### Improving Availability: Two Paths

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Goal[Improve Availability] --> Path1[Increase MTBF<br/>Prevent Failures]
    Goal --> Path2[Decrease MTTR<br/>Recover Faster]

    Path1 --> P1A[Redundancy]
    Path1 --> P1B[Better testing]
    Path1 --> P1C[Chaos engineering]
    Path1 --> P1D[Code quality]

    Path2 --> P2A[Faster detection<br/>MTTD]
    Path2 --> P2B[Faster diagnosis<br/>MTTI]
    Path2 --> P2C[Automated rollback]
    Path2 --> P2D[Runbooks + training]

    Note1["Often easier to reduce<br/>MTTR than increase MTBF"]
```

| Strategy | Impact on MTBF | Impact on MTTR | Investment |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Add redundancy** | 10× better | Slight improvement | High |
| **Automated alerting** | No change | 50% faster detection | Low |
| **Automated rollback** | No change | 80% faster recovery | Medium |
| **Chaos engineering** | 2-3× better | Improves runbooks | Medium |
| **On-call training** | No change | 30-50% faster | Low |

**Interview Insight:** "Reducing MTTR is often more cost-effective than increasing MTBF. A 10-minute MTTR makes even frequent failures invisible to users."

#### MTTR Breakdown

```
MTTR = MTTD + MTTI + MTTR_fix

Where:
  MTTD = Mean Time To Detect (monitoring latency)
  MTTI = Mean Time To Investigate (diagnosis time)
  MTTR_fix = Mean Time To Repair (actual fix time)
```

**Typical Distribution:**

| Phase | Typical % of MTTR | Optimization |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Detection** | 20-30% | Better alerting, anomaly detection |
| **Investigation** | 30-40% | Observability, runbooks, dashboards |
| **Repair** | 30-50% | Automation, rollback capability |

### Reliability Techniques Deep Dive

| Technique | What It Does | When to Use | Trade-off |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Redundancy** | Multiple instances of critical components | Always for production | Cost, complexity |
| **Replication** | Multiple copies of data | When data loss is unacceptable | Storage cost, consistency lag |
| **Checksums** | Detect data corruption | For data integrity | CPU overhead |
| **Idempotency** | Safe retry of operations | For distributed operations | Design complexity |
| **Transactions** | Atomic operations | When consistency is critical | Performance overhead |
| **Circuit breakers** | Prevent cascade failures | For service dependencies | May reject valid requests |
| **Chaos engineering** | Proactive failure testing | Mature systems | Risk of actual outage |

## 5. Efficiency (Latency & Throughput)

### Definitions

| Metric | Definition | Unit | Optimized By |
|--------|------------|------|--------------|
| **Latency** | Time to complete a single operation | ms, μs | Caching, fewer hops, faster components |
| **Throughput** | Operations completed per time unit | req/s, MB/s | Parallelism, batching, scaling |

### The Latency-Throughput Trade-off

**System Invariant (Little's Law):**

> **Reference:** Little, J. D. C. (1961). "A Proof for the Queuing Formula: L = λW." Operations Research.

```
L = λ × W

L = Average number of items in system
λ = Average arrival rate (throughput)
W = Average time in system (latency)
```

**Implication:** With fixed capacity, increasing throughput increases latency (more queuing).

### Percentile Latencies

**Why Percentiles Matter:**

| Metric | What It Tells You | Typical Use |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **p50 (median)** | Typical user experience | General performance |
| **p95** | Experience of 1 in 20 users | SLA threshold |
| **p99** | Experience of 1 in 100 users | Tail latency issues |
| **p99.9** | Worst typical experience | Critical paths |

**System Invariant:** A small percentage of slow requests can dominate user experience. If 1 page load requires 10 service calls, p99.9 latency on each service becomes p99 for the user.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Latency Distribution"
        A[p50: 50ms<br/>Median] --> B[p95: 200ms<br/>SLA Target]
        B --> C[p99: 500ms<br/>Investigate]
        C --> D[p99.9: 2s<br/>Critical Issue]
    end
```

### Queuing Theory Fundamentals

Understanding queuing theory is essential for capacity planning and latency analysis.

#### The M/M/1 Queue Model

The simplest queuing model for a single-server system:

```
                λ (arrival rate)
                    ↓
    ┌───────────────────────────────┐
    │  Queue   →  [Server]  →  Out  │
    └───────────────────────────────┘
                    ↑
              μ (service rate)

Key Metrics:
  ρ = λ/μ         (utilization, must be < 1)
  L = ρ/(1-ρ)     (average items in system)
  W = 1/(μ-λ)     (average time in system)
  Wq = ρ/(μ-λ)    (average wait time in queue)
```

**Critical Insight: The Hockey Stick Curve**

| Utilization (ρ) | Avg Wait Time (×service time) | Practical Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| 50% | 1× | Comfortable headroom |
| 70% | 2.3× | Acceptable for most systems |
| 80% | 4× | Latency starting to hurt |
| 90% | 9× | High latency, near capacity |
| 95% | 19× | Unacceptable for user-facing |
| 99% | 99× | System effectively unusable |

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Utilization vs Latency (Hockey Stick)"
        U50["50%: Low latency"]
        U70["70%: Safe zone"]
        U80["80%: ⚠️ Warning"]
        U90["90%: 🔴 Critical"]
        U95["95%: 💀 Collapse"]
    end

    U50 --> U70 --> U80 --> U90 --> U95
```

**Interview Application:** "When designing for capacity, I target 70% utilization to leave headroom for traffic spikes. At 90% utilization, latency increases 9× due to queuing effects—the system looks idle but users experience long waits."

#### Practical Applications

| Scenario | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Database connections** | Size connection pool for target ρ < 70% |
| **Thread pools** | Threads = target_throughput × avg_latency × (1/target_ρ) |
| **Load balancer health** | Alert when backend utilization > 80% |
| **Capacity planning** | New servers needed = current_load × (1/target_ρ) |

**Thread Pool Sizing Formula:**

```
                    target_throughput × avg_latency
Optimal threads = ─────────────────────────────────
                         target_utilization

Example:
- Target: 1,000 req/s
- Avg latency: 100ms per request
- Target utilization: 70%

Threads = (1000 × 0.1) / 0.7 = 143 threads
```

### Tail Latency Deep Dive

Tail latencies (p99, p99.9) matter more than averages in distributed systems.

#### Why Tail Latencies Compound

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Single Service Call"
        S1["p99 = 100ms"]
    end

    subgraph "Fan-Out to 10 Services"
        F1["Service 1: p99 = 100ms"]
        F2["Service 2: p99 = 100ms"]
        F3["..."]
        F10["Service 10: p99 = 100ms"]
    end

    subgraph "Result"
        R["P(all < 100ms) = 0.99¹⁰ = 90%<br/>User p99 ≈ p90 of slowest!"]
    end

    S1 --> F1
    F1 --> F2 --> F3 --> F10 --> R
```

**The Math:**

```
For N parallel calls, each with latency percentile p:
P(all complete within target) = p^N

Example: 10 services, each p99 = 100ms
- P(all < 100ms) = 0.99^10 = 0.904 (90.4%)
- User experiences p99 at the slowest p90.4 ≈ p90

Implication: To achieve user p99, each service needs p99.9+
```

| Fan-Out | Service p99 Needed | For User p99 |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| 2 services | p99.5 | 0.995² = 0.99 |
| 5 services | p99.8 | 0.998⁵ = 0.99 |
| 10 services | p99.9 | 0.999¹⁰ = 0.99 |
| 50 services | p99.98 | 0.9998⁵⁰ = 0.99 |

#### Tail Latency Causes and Mitigations

| Cause | Symptom | Mitigation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **GC pauses** | Periodic spikes | Tune GC, use low-pause collectors |
| **Background tasks** | Interference with main requests | Separate thread pools |
| **Resource contention** | Lock waiting, connection exhaustion | Bulkheading, sizing |
| **Noisy neighbors** | Shared infrastructure variance | Dedicated resources |
| **Cold caches** | First requests slow | Warmup, preloading |
| **Network outliers** | Packet loss, retransmits | Hedged requests |

**Hedged Requests Pattern:**

```python
# Send request to multiple replicas, use first response
async def hedged_request(replicas, timeout_ms=10):
    # Start primary request
    primary = send_request(replicas[0])

    # After short delay, send hedge to second replica
    await sleep(timeout_ms)  # p50 latency of primary
    hedge = send_request(replicas[1])

    # Return whichever completes first
    return await first_completed([primary, hedge])

# Cost: ~5% extra load for dramatic p99 improvement
```

**Interview Phrase:** "Tail latencies compound with fan-out. If I have 10 downstream services each with p99 of 100ms, my user-facing p99 is determined by the slowest p90. To fix this, I'd use hedged requests, tighten individual service SLOs, or reduce fan-out."

## 6. CAP Theorem

> **Reference:** Brewer, E. (2000). "Towards Robust Distributed Systems." PODC Keynote. Formally proved by Gilbert & Lynch (2002). "Brewer's conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services." ACM SIGACT News.

### The Theorem

In a distributed data system, when a **network partition** occurs, you must choose between:

| Property | Definition | Practical Meaning |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Consistency (C)** | All nodes see the same data at the same time | Every read returns the most recent write |
| **Availability (A)** | Every request receives a response | System responds even if some nodes are down |
| **Partition Tolerance (P)** | System continues despite network failures | Handles network splits between nodes |

### The Real Trade-off

**System Invariant:** Network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems. The real question is: *during a partition, do you sacrifice consistency or availability?*

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "CAP Triangle"
        C[Consistency<br/>Same data everywhere]
        A[Availability<br/>Always respond]
        P[Partition Tolerance<br/>Handle network splits]
    end
    
    C --- A
    A --- P
    P --- C
    
    CP[CP Systems<br/>Consistent but may<br/>be unavailable]
    AP[AP Systems<br/>Available but may<br/>return stale data]
    CA[CA Systems<br/>Single node only<br/>Not distributed]

    CP -.-> P
    AP -.-> A
    AP -.-> P
    CA -.-> C
    CA -.-> A
    
    style CA fill:#ffcdd2,stroke:#c62828

        Note over Node2: AP System Choice
        Node2-->>Client: X = 5<br/>(possibly stale)
    end
```

### CP vs AP Systems

| Aspect | CP Systems | AP Systems |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **During partition** | Reject requests | Accept requests |
| **Guarantee** | Data is always correct | System is always available |
| **Trade-off** | May be unavailable | May return stale data |
| **Recovery** | Resume when partition heals | Reconcile conflicts |
| **Examples** | HBase, MongoDB (default), Spanner, etcd | Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB, Riak |
| **Use cases** | Banking, inventory, reservations | Social feeds, shopping carts, caches |

### CAP Decision Framework

```

### Common CAP Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Pick two of three" | P is mandatory; you choose between C and A during partitions |
| "It's binary" | Spectrum of consistency levels exists |
| "Applies all the time" | Trade-off only matters during partitions |
| "CA is viable" | Not for distributed systems (single node = not distributed) |

### Beyond CAP

CAP only addresses behavior during partitions. What about normal operation?

**PACELC states:**
```
if (Partition) {
    Choose: Availability OR Consistency
} else {
    Choose: Latency OR Consistency
}
```

## 8. Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements

### Definitions

| Type | Question | Examples | Where Discussed |
|------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Functional** | "What should the system do?" | Post messages, process payments, search products | Feature discussions |
| **Non-Functional** | "How should the system behave?" | 99.9% uptime, <100ms latency, 10K req/s | Architecture discussions |

### The Five Essential Non-Functional Questions

Before any system design, establish:

```mermaid
graph TD
    NFR[Non-Functional Requirements] --> Q1[1. SCALE<br/>Users? Data? QPS?]
    NFR --> Q2[2. LATENCY<br/>p50? p99? p999?]
    NFR --> Q3[3. AVAILABILITY<br/>What's the SLA?]
    NFR --> Q4[4. CONSISTENCY<br/>Strong? Eventual?]
    NFR --> Q5[5. DURABILITY<br/>Data loss tolerance?]
    
    Q1 --> A1["10K → 100M users<br/>1TB → 1PB data<br/>100 → 100K QPS"]
    Q2 --> A2["50ms → 500ms p99<br/>Interactive vs batch"]
    Q3 --> A3["99% → 99.999%<br/>Downtime budget"]
    Q4 --> A4["Financial: Strong<br/>Social: Eventual"]
    Q5 --> A5["Zero loss: Banking<br/>Some loss: Analytics"]
```

### Requirements Mapping to Architecture

| Requirement | Architectural Decision | Components Affected |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| High QPS (>10K/s) | Horizontal scaling, caching | Load balancer, cache, DB replicas |
| Low latency (<100ms) | CDN, in-memory cache | Edge servers, Redis |
| High availability (>99.9%) | Multi-region, redundancy | Everything |
| Strong consistency | Synchronous replication | Database, message queue |
| Large data (>1TB) | Sharding, partitioning | Database, storage |

## 9. Back-of-Envelope Estimation

### Why It Matters

Estimation demonstrates you can:
1. **Reason about scale** — understanding orders of magnitude
2. **Identify bottlenecks** — finding the limiting factor
3. **Make informed decisions** — choosing appropriate technologies
4. **Communicate effectively** — grounding discussions in numbers

### Core Reference Numbers

#### Powers of 2

| Power | Exact Value | Approximation | Memory Context |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2^10 | 1,024 | ~1 Thousand | 1 KB |
| 2^20 | 1,048,576 | ~1 Million | 1 MB |
| 2^30 | 1,073,741,824 | ~1 Billion | 1 GB |
| 2^40 | ~1.1 Trillion | ~1 Trillion | 1 TB |
| 2^50 | ~1.1 Quadrillion | ~1 Quadrillion | 1 PB |

#### Time Conversions

| Period | Seconds | Useful Approximation |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 minute | 60 | ~10^2 |
| 1 hour | 3,600 | ~4×10^3 |
| 1 day | 86,400 | ~10^5 (use 100,000) |
| 1 month | 2,592,000 | ~2.5×10^6 |
| 1 year | 31,536,000 | ~3×10^7 (use 30M) |

#### Data Size References

| Data Type | Typical Size |
|-----------|--------------|
| UUID | 16 bytes |
| Timestamp | 8 bytes |
| Integer (64-bit) | 8 bytes |
| Short string (name) | 50 bytes |
| Tweet-sized text | 280 bytes |
| URL | 100 bytes |
| Email address | 50 bytes |
| Typical JSON object | 1-10 KB |
| Small image (thumbnail) | 10-50 KB |
| Medium image | 100-500 KB |
| Large image | 1-5 MB |
| Short video (1 min) | 10-50 MB |

### Core Formulas

#### Requests Per Second (QPS)

```
QPS = (Daily Active Users × Actions per User per Day) / Seconds per Day

Example: Twitter-like service
- 100M DAU
- 10 tweet views per user per day
- QPS = (100M × 10) / 86,400 = 11,574 ≈ 12K QPS
```

#### Storage Requirements

```
Storage = Users × Data per User × Retention Period

Example: Tweet storage for 1 year
- 100M users
- 2 tweets/day × 1KB each = 2KB/day/user
- Storage/year = 100M × 2KB × 365 = 73 TB/year
```

#### Bandwidth

```
Bandwidth = QPS × Average Response Size

Example: Image service
- 10K QPS
- 500 KB average image
- Bandwidth = 10K × 500KB = 5 GB/s = 40 Gbps
```

#### Server Count

```
Servers = Total QPS / QPS per Server

Example: Web tier
- 100K QPS total
- Single server handles 1K QPS
- Servers = 100K / 1K = 100 servers
- With redundancy: 100 × 1.3 = 130 servers
```

### Estimation Walkthrough: Social Media Platform

**Given:**
- 500M MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- 100M DAU (Daily Active Users)
- Each user posts 2 items/day (avg)
- Each user views 100 items/day (avg)
- Average post size: 500 bytes text + 200KB media

**Calculate:**

```
WRITE QPS:
- Posts/day = 100M × 2 = 200M
- Posts/second = 200M / 86,400 ≈ 2,300 QPS
- Peak (3x average) ≈ 7,000 QPS

READ QPS:
- Views/day = 100M × 100 = 10B
- Views/second = 10B / 86,400 ≈ 115,000 QPS
- Peak (3x average) ≈ 350,000 QPS

STORAGE (1 year):
- Text: 200M posts/day × 500B × 365 = 36.5 TB/year
- Media: 200M posts/day × 200KB × 365 = 14.6 PB/year
- Total ≈ 15 PB/year (dominated by media)

BANDWIDTH:
- Reads: 115K QPS × 200KB = 23 GB/s = 184 Gbps
- Writes: 2.3K QPS × 200KB = 460 MB/s = 3.7 Gbps
```

## 10. Serviceability and Manageability

### Definition

How easy is it to operate, maintain, diagnose, and update the system? Often overlooked in design, but critical in production.

### Key Dimensions

| Aspect | Question | Techniques |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Observability** | Can we see what's happening? | Logging, metrics, distributed tracing |
| **Debuggability** | Can we diagnose problems? | Stack traces, request IDs, replay |
| **Deployability** | Can we update safely? | Blue-green, canary, feature flags |
| **Configurability** | Can we change behavior? | Config management, runtime tuning |
| **Testability** | Can we verify correctness? | Unit tests, integration tests, chaos |

### The Three Pillars of Observability

    subgraph "Observability"
        L[Logs<br/>Discrete events]
        M[Metrics<br/>Aggregated measurements]
        T[Traces<br/>Request flow]
    end
    
    L --> Q1["What happened?<br/>Error details, stack traces"]
    M --> Q2["What's the state?<br/>QPS, latency, error rate"]
    T --> Q3["Where did time go?<br/>Service-to-service latency"]
    
    L & M & T --> DIAGNOSE[Complete Picture<br/>for Diagnosis]
```

### Operational Complexity Trade-offs

| Decision | Simpler to Build | Simpler to Operate | Recommendation |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Monolith vs Microservices | Monolith | Monolith (small), Microservices (large) | Start monolith, extract services |
| Single DB vs Sharded | Single | Single (until scale forces sharding) | Delay sharding as long as possible |
| Custom vs Managed | Custom | Managed | Use managed unless custom is essential |
| Sync vs Async | Sync | Sync (simpler debugging) | Use async only when needed |

## Chapter Summary

### Concept Quick Reference

| Concept | One-Line Definition | Key Trade-off |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Scalability** | Handle growth by adding resources | Vertical (simple) vs Horizontal (unlimited) |
| **Availability** | Percentage of time system is accessible | Cost vs uptime guarantees |
| **Reliability** | Probability of correct operation | Validation overhead vs correctness |
| **Efficiency** | Resource utilization for performance | Latency vs throughput |
| **CAP Theorem** | During partition, choose C or A | Consistency vs availability |
| **PACELC** | Without partition, choose L or C | Latency vs consistency |

### Interview Checklist

Before your interview, ensure you can:

- [ ] Explain vertical vs horizontal scaling with concrete trade-offs
- [ ] Calculate availability from component reliabilities
- [ ] Distinguish reliability from availability with examples
- [ ] Recall latency numbers (cache, memory, disk, network)
- [ ] Explain CAP theorem and identify CP vs AP systems
- [ ] Apply PACELC to real database choices
- [ ] Perform back-of-envelope calculations (QPS, storage, bandwidth)
- [ ] Articulate non-functional requirements for any system

### Key Interview Phrases

```
"The trade-off here is..."
"This optimizes for X at the cost of Y..."
"Given the requirement for X, we should choose Y because..."
"If the constraint changes to X, we'd revisit this decision..."
"At this scale, the bottleneck becomes..."
```
